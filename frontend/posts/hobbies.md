# **Hobbies**

## **Tetris**

The main video game I play is Tetris. I enjoy all types of Tetris, but I mostly focus on fast modern Tetris games like [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com) and [Tetrio](https://tetr.io). I play many gamemodes, but I am currently ranked [top 200](https://ch.tetr.io/u/intermittence) in competitive multiplayer. I was also the captain of the Tetr.io team at UCSB during the 2023 and 2024 Collegiate Tetris League seasons.

## **Webnovels**

I spend much of my free time reading translated webnovels, and I always enjoy finding diamonds in the rough.

## **Anime**

Due to various reasons, I haven't been consuming as much anime as before in my life, but I still love the this medium very much and enjoy sharing this passion with other people.
