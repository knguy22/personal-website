# **Projects**

## [**This Personal Website!** ![github-mark.png](/github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/knguy22/personal-website):
### July 2024 â€“ Present

I wanted to try my hand at creating a website that I could do anything I wanted with. Alongside displaying my personal accomplishments, I also wanted to support other functionalities that are useful to me. This website is also self-hosted on my own VPS server and is protected by Cloudflare.

#### Skills Used: 
* Frontend:
  * Javascript, Typescript, HTML
  * Next.js, React, Nginx
  * Tailwind CSS, CSS
* Backend:
  * Rust, SQL (Postgres)
  * Axum

## [**Blocky Chess Engine** ![github-mark.png](/github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/knguy22/Blocky-Chess-Engine): 
### August 2023 - April 2024

As a casual fan of chess, I wanted to create my own chess engine, aka a program that plays chess for you. One skill that was important in the development of this engine was using version control and syncing git changes, which were useful for finetuning Blocky, the engine, in order to play stronger. This was especially relevant since there were multiple developers working on the engine at the same time.

For more detail about techniques used, please see the repo.

#### Skills Used:
* C++
* CMake, GTest
* Test-Driven Development

## [**Tetris Statistics Compiler** ![github-mark.png](/github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/knguy22/Jstris-Stats-Discord-Bot): 
### November 2021 - May 2022

As a competitive Tetris player, it's important to find the right resources and tools in order to train yourself more effective, and I think that [**Jstris**](https://jstris.jezevec10.com) is one of the best clients to do so. However, there are some potentially useful statistics that aren't shown natively on the website.

I identified a potential userbase of Tetris players who wanted more features from Jstris and created a Discord bot in order to serve them the statistics they wanted. **50+ competive Tetris players** ended up benefitting from using the Discord Bot. 

#### Skills Used:
* Python
