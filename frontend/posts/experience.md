## **High School Research Intern (UCSC)**:
### June 2020 â€“ December 2020

I wrote Python code with two other interns under the guidance of a professor at **University of California, Santa Cruz** in order to test a new method of analyzing VERITAS telescope data in order to better verify previously unidentified celestial objects. 

We found statistical confidence improvements that ranged from 14.5% to 17% depending on the energy spectrum and presented the research results for the American Astronomical Society.
